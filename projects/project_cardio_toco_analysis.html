									<H2>1 Abstract</H2>
									<p>The goal of this study is to classify fetal health in 3 categories in order to prevent child and maternal mortality (Normal, Suspicious and Pathological).
										By testing medicale cardiotocographic data ( from Kaggle) on 3 models (KNN, LinearSVC,C-SVC), the more accurate model to predict the health criticity of the patients is the KNN model.
										The PCA modelisation and correlation prove that all CTG variables are need to achieve a good prediction.
									</p>

									<h2>2 Motivation</h2>
									<p>In order to achieve the UNICEF Sustainable Development Goals, all countries aiming to reduce under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.
										Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible medical devices to assess fetal health.
										With ultrasound the CTG measure fetal heart rate, fetal movements, uterine contractions…(11 measurements).
										A good indicator of the fetal health is valuable for healthcare professionals.
									</p>

									<h2>3 Dataset</h2>
									<p>The data set is a csv file downloaded from Kaggle website.
										It is compound of 2126 samples and 22 variables.
										Data came from Ayres de Campos et al. (2000) SisPorto 2.0 A Program for Automated Analysis of Cardiotocograms. J Matern Fetal Med 5:311-318.
									</p>

									<h2>4 Data preparation and Cleaning</h2>
									<p>The most important preparation is to check for the absolute absence of patient identity.
										With the help of a midwife we select the variable available in most CTG.
										The study will contain 2016 samples and 11 variables.
									</p>

									<h3>Variables</h3>	
									<p>
										baseline value, accelerations, fetal_movement, uterine_contractions, light_decelerations, severe_decelerations , prolongued_decelerations ,
										Abnormal_short_term_variability, mean_short_term_variability, abnormal_long_term_variability, long_term_variability.
									</p>

									<h2>5 Research Questions</h2>
									<p>Main question:
										Is it possible to predict fetal health with CTG variables? With what precision?
									</p>
									<p>Secondary question:
										When predict fetal health, does some CTG variables useless ? Could we simplify the CTG interface?
									</p>

									<h2>6 Methods</h2>
									<p>Does some CTG variables useless?
										a/ Correlation between variables
										b/ Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
										</p>

									<p>Is it possible to predict fetal health? With what precision?
										a/ Find the best fitting model, data split
										b/ Support vector machines: LinearSVC
										c/ Nearest Neighbors Classification
										d/ Support vector machines: C-Support Vector Classification
										</p>

									<h2>Findings: Does some CTG variables more usefull?</h2>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="../images/projects/cardio_toco/figure1.png" alt="heatmap"/></a>
									<p>We can't see any strong correlation between the variables (less than 0.5).
										A variables reduction will be difficult.
									</p>

									<p>Principal component analysis of the samples 
									</p>
									<p>Correlation between variables
									</p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="../images/projects/cardio_toco/figure2.png" alt="Correlation"/></a>
									<p>The PCA show us that the 3 groups are mixed.

										Generally, the more the groups are mixed, the more variables are need to achieve an accurate classification. 
									</p>

									<p>Principal component analysis of the variables 
									</p>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="../images/projects/cardio_toco/figure3.png" alt="PCA projection"/></a>


									<p>The variables PCA shows spread variable around the circle.

										The vector of most of the variables is long (>0.5).
										
										Wich mean that the variable reduction won’t be possible without losing too much information.
										</p>

									<p>Explained inertia by principal components 
									</p>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="../images/projects/cardio_toco/figure3.png" alt="Explained inertia"/></a>

									<p>The main component (0) is small: 0.25.
										The second too: 0.15
										
										Wich mean that these 2 components explain only 40% of the information.
										
										The total of the other component explain 60% of the information.
										
										To explain a fetal health accurately the 11 variables are needed.
									</p>

									<h2>Findings: Is it possible to predict fetal health?</h2>
									<p>a/Find the best fitting model, data split
									</p>
									<p>The samples had been split in 2 group:
										40% as train samples
										60% as test samples
										</p>
										
										<p>	10 runs had been done with each model in order to ensure results stability.
										</p>

									<h4>Support vector machines (SVMs) LinearSVC
									</h4>
									<p>LinearSVC with 10000 iteration => accuracy score: 0.786</p>
									<h4>Nearest Neighbors Classification</h4>
									<p>KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3) => accuracy score: 0.874
									</p>

									<h4>Support vector machines: C-Support Vector Classification
									</h4>
									<p>SVC() => accuracy score: 0.813
									</p>

									<p>The KNN is the more accurate over the 3 models.
									</p>
									

									<h2>Findings: Test of the selected model with midwives usual values</h2>
									<p>his is a real life model test using the variables traced by midwives in the patient report:
										baseline value,  accelerations, uterine_contractions,
										light_decelerations, severe_decelerations,
										prolongued_decelerations, long_term_variability.
										</p>

									<p>KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3) => accuracy score: 0.756
									</p>

									<p>Because of the lack of some values, the model accuracy is lower: 0.756 < 0.874</p>

									<h2>Limitations</h2>
									<p>Because of the limitation of the number of samples, the model is fragile. With a larger sample, the model would be more accurate and thrustable.
										Other important variables are missing, like gestational age and pregnancy pathologies.
										</p>

									<h2>Conclusions</h2>
									<p>ACT and correlation between variables prove that all 11 variables are needed for accurate diagnostics. In clinic, the midwives usent all of those variable to estimate the patient risk.
									</p>

									<p>The model use to predict fetal health score an accuracy of more than 85%.
										The prediction seems good, but only as a proposal value, not for a medical diagnostic.
										</p>
